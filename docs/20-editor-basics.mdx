## Camera Controls
The camera has two modes `Fly` and `Orbit`. 
`Fly Mode` allows for free control of the camera. 
`Orbit Mode` focuses and rotates the camera around one point. 

Use the mouse buttons, mouse wheel and `WASD` to control the camera. Press `Shift` to move faster. 
The tools panel has a `Reset Position` button to reset the camera.

The `Paint` brush has various blend modes which you may know from Photoshop. See a list of explanations [here](https://photoshoptrainingchannel.com/blending-modes-explained/#normal-blending-modes).
