The following functions are available for debugging

## Text

Prints will appear in the lua console and the most recent one in the bottom left corner of the screen.
```lua title="Print 'hello world' into the lua console"
print("hello world")
```

Any value can be printed, including tables
```lua
local table = {"hello", "world", self.object}
print(table)
```

You can print as many values as you want
```lua
print(self.object.name, "children:", self.object.children)
```

## Crosses

All debug draws can be cleaned up with `Tab`

```lua title="Draw a cross at the origin"
deb:cross(Vec3(0))
```

You can add a text label to the cross
```lua
deb:cross(Vec3(1,2,3), "hello")
```

You can change the color of the cross
```lua
local col = Vec3(1,0,1) --pink
deb:cross(Vec3(1,2,3), "hello", col)
```

Use `deb:clear()` to remove all drawings. That way you can also draw only for one frame
```lua
deb:clear()
deb:cross(self.transform.pos)
```

## Lines

Line from start pos to end pos
```lua
local startPos = Vec3(1,2,3)
local endPos = Vec3(4,5,6)
deb:line(startPos, endPos)
```

Ray from start
```lua
local start = Vec3(1,2,3)
local ray = Vec3.forward * 10
deb:ray(start, ray)
```

## Shapes

You can draw any shape
```lua title="Draw a 1m box at the origin"
local sh = Box(Vec3(0), Vec3(1))
deb:draw(sh)
```
