# Using VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is our recommended tool for Lua programming in Atomontage. It provides API autocompletions and Lua [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) through the official Atomontage extension.

## Set VS Code as your Lua editor
Open the Lua window (`Ctrl + L`) and specify the path to your `Code.exe` of your VS Code install.

## Installing the Atomontage Extension

Install the Atomontage API Extension [**here**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AtomontageInc.vscode-atomontage-lua). The Atomontage extension provides API autocompletions for classes, properties, functions and parameters. 
It also comes with the [Lua Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua) to provide IntelliSense for Lua.
